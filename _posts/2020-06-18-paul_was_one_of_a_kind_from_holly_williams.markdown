As a lifelong friend of Laurie's, we were all friends although we never  lived close enough to see each other very often.  I saw Laurie every  year at our high school girlfriends reunions, but only saw Paul on  occasion.   After Lauries passing, Paul and I spoke more often and  texted quite a bit.   Here are a few of the last texts I saved from him. This was a shared  text with our friend Ellie Staib. Friday, Sept 6, 2020 "Camille Laura Day #2.  I think she got more beautiful overnight!" (Send  with picture) "I don't have to tell you how much Laurie would have been going goo goo,  ga ga over this little angel.  Lia sees a resemblance but I want to  give it more time.  Right now I think she is simply a uniquely new and  beautiful life form.  Thank you and Dave for being such good friends of  Laurie's (and ours).  We share sorrow and joy.  Isn't that the very  definition of a friend?" "Laurie taught me the importance of being honest and sincere with my  feelings.  Now I don't know any other way to be."

I have been trying to put into words my memories of Paul.  He was always  fun, lively, entertaining, charming, and never at a loss for words!   Huge smile and big bear hug.  Unconcerned with what others thought of  him.  Unique in every way.  A good hearted man.  You always felt like  you were the only person in the room when you engaged in conversation  with him.  He put his whole heart and self into everything.  What you  see was what you got with Paul.  Open, honest to a fault, and  passionate.  The world ls a smaller place without his large personality.   They are together again.  Most sincere sympathies to his family.
