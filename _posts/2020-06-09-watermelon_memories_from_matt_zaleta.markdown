My sister and I always considered Uncle Paul as the 'fun uncle' because of his endless energy, loud laugh, and funny stories.  I remember one hot summer day, when we cousins were children, cooling off around the kitchen table at the Mastropolo's and eating watermelon.  Uncle Paul started telling us a story, "I used to know this guy who loved to eat the green part of the watermelon....**long pause**.....and his name was Paul Mastropolo!!!"  And then he took a big bite of the watermelon rind!  The shocked kids erupted into a chorus of laughter, "ewwwww's", and amazement.  He then told us how he's always liked the bitter taste of it, and to this day he's the only person I've met who eats the rind.  It was an unforgettable memory and one of the many examples of him being the 'fun uncle'.
