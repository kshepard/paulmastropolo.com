This photo of Paul, along with his cousins, taken at Grandmaâ€™s  60th Birthday party, is a testament to the special times we had  gathering at his house in Westchester.  Standing next to Paul with his  impish smile, I truly enjoyed his ebullient sense of humor and the way he made me laugh each time we were together. I learned that he was not  only a comedian but, also, a master thinker. Our conversations about life were  filled with lively banter and, at times, deep speculation.

Throughout our youth and until the day he left this earthly abode  he brought joy to me and to all of those who were privileged to know and  to love him. He was filled with heartfelt compassion and kindness for  others and will be remembered fondly.
  
Be at peace now with your lovely Laurie, dear cousin.  I will truly miss you!
