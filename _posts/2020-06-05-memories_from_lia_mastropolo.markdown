It hurts to think of “memories” and “Dad” in the same sentence. I don’t think I’ll ever get used to speaking of him in the past tense. His presence seems to extend into this new hard place where his body isn’t any more.

Dad loved this world, and us, his people, and so much else. I want to share few memories of what it felt like to share some of this time with him. And of course, what it felt like—what it still feels like—to be his loved daughter.  Because when I think of my dad I think of everything he loved, and I hope you will too.

How do I know he loved my mom, my sister and I more than anything? He spent every spare minute with us. He came home for lunch almost every day of his professional career. He was home from the office by 5:30pm every night. He planned long family vacations where we hiked and swam and learned about the nature and people of New England together.  When I was young and he had to go to the hospital to make rounds on the weekends, he often brought me with him so I could learn about his job, look at the EKGs alongside him, hear him speak into the dictaphone, or meet a favorite patient.

When I was very young, he would sit with me in a hammock strung between two trees on our front lawn and play his harmonica. A favorite was Amazing Grace—he’d learned how to trill the high note just right. When he taught me the words, I imagined Grace was a young girl, someone’s daughter.  What I mean is, I never questioned that the song was made just for me.

When mom passed away in 2019, I had just gotten pregnant. I was nauseous and a little scared, and missing her horribly. I started calling Dad on my drive home from work every night—to check in on him, I told myself. We talked about how much we missed her. We talked about the long walks he took alone that long cold winter. We talked about my excitement and worries about becoming a new mom. And everything else, and nothing—it was just so comforting to hear his voice.

My daughter Camille was born in September of 2019. Dad came down to Philadelphia armed with a whole menu of recipes and ingredients that he cooked for us that first week. He found the words to an old Italian song his grandmother used to sing to him, and he sang it to Camille, first in person, then over video calls after he’d gone back home.

When we learned the cancer he’d had for years had started to advance, Kenny, Camille and I moved in with Dad in Bristol. Though he was a bit limited by then, we were still able to enjoy stroller walks along the Farmington River, and dinners out on the back porch. We read and watched Netflix. He dusted off his harmonica for Camille. It felt like a vacation, almost. The memory of those last two and a half months with him is a gift I will carry with me forever.
