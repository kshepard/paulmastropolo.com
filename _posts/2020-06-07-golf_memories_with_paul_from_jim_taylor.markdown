I, along with Lee Cranford and Henry Bentley had the privilege of  golfing with Paul on many occasions.  We always had a small wager on our  match and Paul would be so competitive just to save a quarter.  We had  so many laughs over the years.  Paul decided to join us on our annual  March Florida golf trip one year and was so excited.  The first morning  he came running down the stairs from his bedroom and hollered, "is the  coffee on". I said yes, and he ran into the kitchen and made a cup of  coffee and took a couple of big gulps.  I asked him why he needed his  jolt of coffee in the morning so bad.  He said, "last night I left my  glasses on the kitchen table when I went to bed.  I got up this morning  and showered and brushed my teeth.  Unfortunately, I grabbed the tube of  sunscreen instead of the toothpaste.  I really needed that coffee."   The entire week was so much fun and we had many laughs.  R.I.P. my  friend, we are going to miss you.
