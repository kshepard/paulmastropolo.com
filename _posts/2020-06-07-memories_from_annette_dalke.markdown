As a registered nurse working at Bristol Hospital, I had the pleasure of  working with Dr. Mastropolo in the ED and later in the Cardiology  Department. He was professional, pleasant and always served with a  smile. He was caring and had a genuine concern for his beloved patients.  He was loved and well respected by all. Rest In Peace Dr. Mastropolo.
