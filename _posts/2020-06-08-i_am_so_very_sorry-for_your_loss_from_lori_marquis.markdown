I was a patient of Paul's for many years but he was also a very dear  friend of our family.  My parents Bob and Nancy Avolt, lived down the  hill from Paul.  Dad used to keep the field cut next to the house and  plowed his driveway with the tractor when necessary.  They were great  friends.  Paul and Laurie helped us celebrate  Dad's 75th birthday 2  summers ago and it was wonderful to have them in our home.  Paul was  such a vibrant person and he will be missed by our family and  undoubtedly many, many others.  I am so very sorry for your loss.
