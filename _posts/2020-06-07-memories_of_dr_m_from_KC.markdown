It is very difficult to type this through tears.  Paul Mastropolo will  forever be Dr M. to me.  I asked if I could call him that when I started  working for him in 1997!  Dr Mastropolo, took too much time to say each  time!  It took me awhile, but I earned his trust working in the office,  and once I did that, we became friends.   I did know Dr M. from working at Bristol hospital.  He was a well  respected physician who was a wonderful advocate for his patients.  One  of my favorite memories of him there, was that he always brought a bag  of pistachios to each department and nursing floor as a gift for  Christmas!  It was always everyone's favorite treat! When I started as his medical assistant in the office, I really got to  know him.  He was a very complex man.  I used to joke him that I was  putting the pieces of his life puzzle together one by one.  Every time I  learned something new about him, I would say that's another puzzle  piece!  I'd like to say I completed the puzzle, but I think that  would've taken a lot more years! My memories of him at the office were  that he always treated his patients and staff very respectfully!  He was  interested in everyone's lives as much as their physical ailments.  He  was extremely gullible and we would trick him every April Fools day!  It  was almost too easy. Plus he had a very colorful vocabulary.  He said  for people him to take him as he was, or leave him!!  Most people kept  him!   Others have spoken of his infectious laugh and that was my  absolute favorite memory of him.  I could be having the most challenging  day and I would hear his laugh roaring down the hallway and it always  made me smile!   Larry and I also became friends outside of the office with Dr M and his  beautiful wife Laurie.  We did many things together.  We would try new  restaurants during the "taste of Hartford".  We went to plays and  concerts together.  We enjoyed many evenings beer tasting and sitting  and watching nature on his back porch.  One of my favorite memories of  Dr M. was  at a concert in Simsbury.  We were outside listening to the  Hartford Symphony and they were doing a tribute to the Rolling Stones.   He loved the music so much and he couldn't contain himself, and just got  up and started dancing alone in front of everyone!  He said he just  couldn't sit still!  I loved that about him, truly enjoying life and  love and music!  He was a very inquisitive man.  He would always ask me  "KC, what's it all about?"  We had a lot of very philosophical talks and  that was also my favorite thing about him.  He made you think, not just  about the fluff that life brings, but about yourself and what it is.  I  mean what is this life all about? When Laurie passed away so tragically, I thought he would break.  I  remember bringing him to the labyrinth at Holy Family retreat center in  the beginning of February.  It was just him and I there, and he just  wailed.  I don't know how people live through that pain, but he did.  He  wanted to figure out what this phase of his life meant.  Just like I am  trying so hard now to figure out what this phase of my life without him  in it means!  I will always remember our visits with "tea and  crumpets".  We never actually ate crumpets though, it was usually  biscotti that I brought him!  I was honored to accompany him to his many  doctor appointments and treatments.  I felt he was able to talk to me  about the stuff that he would normally bounce off Laurie.  I was always  impressed with the love he showed his family.  He was a family man above  all else.  He loved his daughters and protected them with all he had!   When Lia gave birth to Camille, I started to see the light come  back in  his eyes!  He cherished that little girl! I was so glad that the final  days of his life included being able to see her everyday.   I'm sure I am forgetting so many things that I would want to share about  my friend, Dr M.  I just want to say that I will miss him.  He could  drive me insane at times, and I will miss that too.  I will miss our  teas, and beers, and dinners, and hugs and talks. One of our last texts  between us included that I'm thinking of him everyday, and he responded "  and I love you everyday!"  He also asked me to "stay close."  I promise  to stay close if you will, Dr M.   I will  be looking for monarch  butterflies!
