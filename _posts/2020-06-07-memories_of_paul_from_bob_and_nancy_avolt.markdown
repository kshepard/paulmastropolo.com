Bob & I have only the fondest memories of Paul, He was the best and  most caring Doctor ever, and also a good friend. Will always remember  bringing hay up for the horses. Never a dull moment, always a big smile  and a hearty laugh. So glad he was able to spend his final days with his  girls and granddaughter who he was so anxious to see. We couldn't have  asked for a better neighbor or friend. We'll never forget you Paul. Love from Nancy & Bob
