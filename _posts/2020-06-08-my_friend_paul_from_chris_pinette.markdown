So many memories of my friend Paul, with his huge heart, his prodigious  mind, his (sometimes wicked) humor and yes -  that laugh!  I will share a few stories, hoping they will remind you of your stories  of Paul.  When I retired in 2019, I resolved to get out of my "rut"  hiking the same safe, familiar trails.  Anyone who knows me will know  that I lack any sense of direction, and solo hikes are, for me,  high-risk behavior.  Tackling the maze of interconnected branches of the  Tunxis trail on one hike,  I lost all trail markers and ended up in a  dense brushy bog with no clue which way to go.  When I finally heard  traffic, I bushwhacked to the paved road and walked 2 hours to get home  via streets.  Subsequently, my friend Paul gave me the Best Ever,  updated Complete Guide to CT's Blue Blazed Trails. We both enjoyed solo  hikes and time outside in Nature, and took to sending each other our GPS  locations when we started off on an adventure, and again when we  arrived home.    An avid reader, Paul read mostly non-fiction, essays and philosophy for  much of his life-even tackling Montaigne until he lost the fat volume on  the train visiting Philadelphia.  After Laurie's death, he  began  reading fiction to discover reading what she enjoyed.  His favorites  were often books recommended by Lia or his cousin Linda, which he would  then share with me.   I so enjoyed talking with Paul about what we were  reading. He elevated the art of conversation to its full potential. Paul  really wanted to know what people thought and how they felt.  He asked  hard questions about difficult subjects and really listened.  One of his  greatest gifts to me was his honesty. He held his friends to a high  standard, and made me want to be a better person.   The  olives.  After I commented a few times on how much I enjoyed the  olives he served, Paul presented me with the largest jar of  Castelvetrano green olives  I have ever seen in my life.  As I pour a glass of wine and enjoy some olives,  I'll remember my  Friend Paul.  I won't need to check my phone for his GPS location.  His  spirit is with Laurie and close to all the people he loves.
