What I cherish most about my father was how undyingly helpful he was.  Only a couple years ago I told him I was sick and wished that someone  would bring me Progresso Italian Wedding soup (his favorite), and he  said, "Oh my God, I will!! Can I bring it over now??" Of course, I  laughed and said that he didn't have to, but I thought it was one of the  sweetest of the countless acts of love that he showed me in his life.  He would go to the ends of the earth for his girls, and he truly did. We  were so blessed to have him for the time that we did, and I shared SO  many loud laughs, happy hours, deep conversations, even seeing Billy  Joel in a limo with him for his birthday, just him and I! On his  deathbed, he brought up one of our favorite memories, singing "Only the  Good Die Young," at the most shameful dive bar I used to frequent in my  20s, during Karaoke night. We shared that memory with Aunt Joan, who  sang "New York, New York," complete with her famous dance routine. He  got me inspiring Mantra Band bracelets for my birthday 7 years in a row,  while I was going through the challenging process of becoming a teacher  and losing mom. I have never taken them off, and even returned the  gesture with a men's version that said, "I love you to the moon and  back." He made it possible for Lia and I to get amazing educations, free  of debt which we will be forever grateful. I feel so proud to be  Italian and to have had such a close, loving, and supportive family. I  will miss and love my amazing father forever, but feel at peace that he  is with the love of his life, watching over us and continuing to guide  us. Rock the heavens, Dad!
