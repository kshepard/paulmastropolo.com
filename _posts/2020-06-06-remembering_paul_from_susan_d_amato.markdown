Paul and I had some wonderful discussions through the many years of our  friendship...we discussed life and politics and growing up Italian and  raising daughters and our beloved Red Sox! Paul was my friend - at times  my confidante (with Laurie). He was, at all times, my cheerleader and  my supporter.  I will always cherish the laughs we shared and the  memories that I hold deep in my heart. It comforts me to know that Paul  is resting in peace with his beloved Laurie!
