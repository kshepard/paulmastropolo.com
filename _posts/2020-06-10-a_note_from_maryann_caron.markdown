I am soooo sorry Lia...I loved your family and i am shocked to hear of  your dad's passing. I know it's part of life but it's so hard. I had a  hard time hearing of your mom and now dad. I will keep you, Anna and your  BEAUTIFUL family in my daily prayers. Please let Anna know, how sorry I  am as well. It's hard, but your mom and dad will never be forgotten, what a great  team they were and now they are together again.
