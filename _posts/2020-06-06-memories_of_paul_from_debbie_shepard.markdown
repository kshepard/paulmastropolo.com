What I remember most is how happy Paul always was. Always smiling and  upbeat, always in a good mood. He just loved Laurie, Lia and Anna so  much. I remember Kenny and Lia's wedding. Paul and Laurie were so happy.  Both smiling and dancing the night away. Paul was just so happy and  proud. He was a wonderful man.
