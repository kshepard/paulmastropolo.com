Most of my adult life has been touched by the kindness of Paul. When he  asked "How are you?", he was genuinely interested in your answer. His  calm demeanor and strong convictions helped me navigate health crises  with my parents.  Our families were joined in the 80's through La Leche League and the  bond remains today. We always had so much fun together. Paul's  enthusiasm and sense of humor was at the heart of our gatherings. I  thank Paul for the privilege of being close to him and his wonderful  family.
