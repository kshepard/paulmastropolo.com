There are persons that are a force of good and have a positive impact on  our earth and human family.  Team Laurie and Paul each were such  persons.   In these difficult times we are now more than ever thankful  for who they were.  Bravely thinking outside the box in their choices.    Fiercely protective of rights.   Devoted to those they loved,  especially the girls they were so proud of .   The world is a better  because of them.
