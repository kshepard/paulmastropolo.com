I have so many wonderful incredible memories of Uncle Paul. Seems like  yesterday when we went to visit him at Georgetown. He and Uncle Peter  was so cool to us as kids! Many great familial inside jokes that only we  understand! Glad they have been passed down to my own children. A  favorite recent memory was of him about to leave a family wedding; he  said goodbye to everyone, which took about an hour! And the the band  started playing The Stones and Uncle Paul, as if on cue, tore to the  dance floor! I will miss your laugh. Rest easy.
