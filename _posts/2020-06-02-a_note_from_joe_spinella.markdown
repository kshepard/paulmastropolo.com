I first met Paul 39 years ago this July. We shared much during this time. Professional issues were first. Personal issues followed. Love, support, and vulnerability later. As I reflect on these years, I am at a loss to adequately express what they mean to me. What Paul means to me.

The best I can do is say, "My Friend", love you Paul,

Joe Spinella
