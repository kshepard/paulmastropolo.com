I always felt as though I was privileged to have had a unique and  special connection with Paul. One thing that we had in common was our  highly emotional connection to music. Unlike many people, Paul had no  discomfort expressing his emotions and feelings and I always appreciated  how free that made me feel. Around him I felt as though I had  permission to feel and express myself without judgement, be human and I  felt understood. When we talked about music together he would really  listen. When I was in college and first started teaching I remember  telling Uncle Paul about a young new student, and how excited she was  that I had introduced her to Broadway repertoire. To most people this wouldn’t be a big deal, but Paul had tears of joy in  his eyes for me when I told him this, he knew how special it was for  me. I can’t listen to Paul Simon without immediately thinking of Paul,  especially Graceland. I’m forever grateful to have known him and to have  been a part of his family.
