I first met Paul shortly after I joined the BBWE about 8 years ago. Paul  was always fun and interesting to talk to, and we became good friends. I  play the clarinet in the band, and when Paul decided to try playing the  clarinet as well as the alto sax, he came to visit me twice so we could  play our clarinets together and I could possibly give him a few tips.  It was like the blind leading the blind, but it was also a lot of fun. I  also played golf with Paul, until he left me in the dust. He was always  a much better golfer than me. Like most golfers, my playing got worse  with age. Paul, on the other hand, played better as he got older. Just  last summer, he told me he was playing his best ever and couldn't  believe how consistently well he was hitting the ball. He will be deeply  missed by a lot of friends, patients, and band members as well as by my  wife, Marcia, and me.
